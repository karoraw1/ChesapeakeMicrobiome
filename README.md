# ChesapeakeMicrobiome

- look at ridge coefficients to see how clustering separates preditive groups
- rerun ridge/lasso for time/place, export final figures, writeup
- rerun lasso for responsive populations and calcuate F1, Precision, and relative accuracy
- make writeup and include interesting tidbits
- why is species diversity important motivation eg. Stability, resilience
- clarify final objective 
- change the table to a flowchart to show variable selection importance
	-  emphasize in the text that latitude was not selected 
- add color to the map
-  add color to the figure to define groups
- sort the coefficients in the corrplot of coefficient loadings
- phylogenetic tree version of site occupancy
- find background for chapter 3
